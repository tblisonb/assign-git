What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

 - A file that specifies which files/file types should not be included in the GitHub repository (because they're temporary or machine dependent). For a Java project this would include compiled .class files, .log files, IDE files like .ctxt, and any package files like .jar, .zip, etc.


What does fast-forward in Git mean?

 - A fast-forward means that a given series of commits on a separate branch are non-divergent, and all the changes up to the last commit can safely be merged into the original branch without creating conflicts.


Why should you have different branches?

 - Branches are useful for developing new features which may create issues with the existing system. By implementing these on a separate branch the stable branch(es) like master remain working.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
